Achievements 7.x-1.5, 2011-XX-XX
--------------------------------
 * (todo) Add some links for good achievement design?
 * (todo) Allow users to choose if they can opt-out of achievements.


Achievements 7.x-1.4, 2011-11-10
--------------------------------
 * achievement-latest-unlock.tpl.php added and used in the leaderboard.
 * All template files have been moved to templates/ subdirectory.
 * Most .tpl.php $variables are now render arrays instead of strings.
  * This allows for easier modifications in preprocess hooks.
  * You WILL need to modify any overridden themes to support this.
  * You should be able to just replace "print $a" with "print render($a)";
 * "image_path" added to themes for the context-aware image path.
 * "achievement_title" added to themes for easier linked title display.
 * "achievement_points" added to themes as a renderable "$n points" string.
 * Fixed double-encoding bug in titles of achievements/leaderboard/$AID.
 * achievements_locked() added for programmatic taking away of an unlock.
 * achievements_storage_del() added to complement the _set and _get ones.
 * tabindex on achievement notification was rewritten into a CSS override.
 * #theme => 'achievement' usage has gained contextual theme suggestions.
 * Admins can no longer take away an achievement the user hasn't unlocked.
 * An empty relative leaderboard table is no longer displayed in the HTML.
 * "achievement-leaderboard-top-rank" CSS class added to top 3 rank rows.
 * "achievement-leaderboard-top-rank-[123]" CSS class added to top 3 rank rows.
 * theme_achievements_group_wrapper() added (wraps around user/#/achievements).
 * theme_achievement_group_wrapper() added (wraps around an achievement group).
 * Stats on user/#/achievements are themed with theme_achievement_user_stats().
 * Achievement popups do not fade out if you hover over them (thanks Poetro).
 * New hook added: hook_achievements_leaderboard_alter().
  * Lets you add new table columns or heavily modify leaderboard display.
  * Context (type of leaderboard, block, etc.) and raw data is passed.
  * See achievements.api.php for full details about the new hook.


Achievements 7.x-1.3, 2011-09-29
--------------------------------
 * The following hooks have been added. See achievements.api.php for details:
  * hook_achievements_info_alter() - modify the achievement information.
  * hook_achievements_unlocked() - respond to achievement unlocks.
  * hook_achievements_locked() - respond to a user losing an achievement.
 * Relative leaderboards have been added.
  * The block and global leaderboard can now show user-specific stats.
  * The current user's ranking can be displayed, along with "nearby" users.
  * "Nearby" users are a number of ranks before and after the current user.
  * The number of nearby ranks shown can be 0 through 10.
  * The block and global leaderboard can be configured separately.
 * The global leaderboard now shows a user's latest achievement.
 * New leaderboard CSS class added: achievements-leaderboard-current-user.
 * The global leaderboard is now a paged view instead of a set limit.
  * Control number of ranks per page at admin/config/people/achievements/.
 * achievements_totals() no longer exists; moved inline to leaderboard page.
 * achievements_totals_user() has been rewritten with different parameters.
 * We now load all of a user's unlocks in achievements_unlocked_already().
  * This is then cached for all future lookups during that page load.
  * a_u_a and a_u can be called a lot per page for heavy achievement sites.
  * Loading all and caching is better, performance-wise, then lots of singles.
 * The database tables have been tweaked to support latest-unlock lookups.
 * Issue #1274350 by makononov: added query tags for the leaderboards.
 * Fixed some warnings that appeared in a first-time installation.


Achievements 7.x-1.2, 2011-09-07
--------------------------------
 * Achievement unlock notifications are now JS fadeins and offline-able.
  * We no longer use drupal_set_message() to inform of an unlock.
  * A new achievement-notification.tpl.php controls the appearance.
  * Unlock notifications now fade in and out at the window's bottom right.
  * We now track whether a user has seen an achievement unlock notification.
  * If they haven't, they will the next time they login or access the site.
 * Leaderboard top rank counts can now be tweaked in the relevant configs.
  * This is in preparation for "relative leaderboards" planned for 7.x-1.3.
 * Unlocked achievements on user/#/achievements can now be unsorted.
  * That is, instead of "move to top" they can remain "as defined in code".
  * Defaults to "move to top". Config at admin/config/people/achievements.
 * Block 'achievements-leaderboard' renamed with underscores not dashes.
  * If you're using this block, you'll need to place it again upon upgrade.
 * Fixed a few PHP warnings when a user has yet to unlock any achievements.
 * Achievement unlocks are now logged in watchdog.
 * Variables are now properly deleted on uninstall.


Achievements 7.x-1.1, 2011-07-18
--------------------------------
 * Achievements can now be categorized into groups.
  * Grouped achievements will be displayed within jQuery UI tabs.
  * If groups exist, ungrouped achievements "upgrade" automatically.
  * See achievements.api.php for more on how to define achievement groups.
 * Achievements can now have images.
  * Three possible display states: locked, unlocked, and hidden.
  * Admins may set the default images at admin/config/people/achievements.
  * An 'images' array has been added to hook_achievements_info() definitions.
  * Per-achievement images can override the default on a per-state basis.
  * CSS tweaks were made for a more flexible achievement display.
  * Default images have been provided for each of the three states.
 * Administrators can now manually give and take achievements from users.
  * It's problematic on progression-based achievements and internal statistics.
  * hook_achievements_info() gets 'storage' to define where statistics are kept.
  * If 'storage' is not specified, assume it exists under the achievement ID.
  * See admin/config/people/achievements for the disclaimer text on usage.
  * See achievements.api.php for more on 'storage' and a revised HOWTO.
 * A new permission, "Earn achievements", has been added.
  * It is REQUIRED and NECESSARY for all roles that can unlock achievements.
  * Core functions check for it so you shouldn't need it in your own code.
  * If you think you need to check, use achievements_user_is_achiever().
  * Removing this permission from a role does NOT delete data or ranks.
  * It does stop, however, the collection of new data, points, or unlocks.
 * achievements/leaderboard/NONEXISTENT now returns a 404.
 * Locked achievements are now displayed on a user's achievements tab.
 * No more warnings when viewing a user with no achievement unlocks.
 * 'id' is no longer duplicated in hook_achievements_info() definitions.
 * achievements.tpl.php has had its PHP moved to template_preprocess_hook().
  * New variables have been added to streamline the display code.


Achievements 7.x-1.0, 2011-07-07
--------------------------------
 * First release for Drupal 7.x.
